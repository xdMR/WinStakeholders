                    Decisions program</strong>. </p>
            <p>This 16-week program has everything you need to master each of the <strong>8 Pillars of Stakeholder
                    Influence</strong>. You’ll work closely with the program leaders, Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman and Jared
                Spool, to learn new skills, attain a new set of tools, and develop the necessary influential-leadership
                mindset to propel your career in a whole new (and much more fun) direction.</p>

            <p><strong>Meet the 8 Pillars:</strong> <br>
                Every two weeks, for the 16-weeks of the program, Leslie and Jared will introduce you to a brand new
                pillar of stakeholder influence. They’ll share the techniques, tips, and methods that will expand your
                current skill set and put you on a path to success.</p>
            <p><strong>Practice your new skills:</strong> <br>
                During the two weeks, you’ll develop a plan for how you’ll put your new skills into practice. You’ll see
                what works best for you and start building new habits of persuasion and influence.</p>
            <p><strong>Live Coaching Sessions:</strong>  <br>
                Each week, join one of our live coaching sessions, where Leslie, Jared, and the Center Centre team work
                with you and your fellow program attendees. Receive mentoring on your questions, big challenges, and
                plans for how you’ll win support and influence change.</p>
            <p>We’ll host the sessions in a private program space inside our <strong>Leaders of Awesomeness</strong>
                community. There you’ll find the recordings for all the lessons and coaching sessions, along with
                session notes and workbooks for the practice sessions. You’ll have access to that space as long as
                you’re in the program (with an option to extend access once the program ends).</p>

                that you’ll use every day for the lifetime of your UX career. We’ve seen UX professionals take these

                <li>growing their UX team to better keep pace with product and development.</li>
                <li>expanding their organization’s research capability to influence strategic decisions.</li>
                <li>shifting their organization to stop <em>saying</em> they’re customer-centered, and instead <em>truly
