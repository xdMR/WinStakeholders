      <div class="pt-2">
        <p>
          Every UX leader reaches a point where their work needs to shift.
          Creating great designs and conducting meaningful UX research isn’t
          enough. They must overcome the pressures of the organization and,
          most importantly, they need the help of key stakeholders to make
          that happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          UX is a team sport. You need support and buy-in from your partners
          in product management and development. However, that support won’t
          come by itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve spent the last two decades studying how successful UX leaders
          get their peers to make UX a top priority. We’ve collected the
          techniques and perspectives that give these UX leaders an advantage
          in their organization.

        We want you to get the support you need to attain a new level in your
        UX career.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why we invite you to enroll in our brand new
        <strong>How to Win Stakeholders &amp; Influence Decisions program</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This 16-week program has everything you need to master each of the
        <strong>8 Pillars of Stakeholder Influence</strong>. You’ll work
        closely with the program leaders, Dr. Leslie Jensen-Inman and Jared
        Spool, to learn new skills, attain a new set of tools, and develop the
        necessary influential-leadership mindset to propel your career in a
        whole new (and much more fun) direction.

        Here’s how the program works…
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Meet the 8 Pillars:</strong> <br />
        Every two weeks, for the 16-weeks of the program, Leslie and Jared
        will introduce you to a brand new pillar of stakeholder influence.
        They’ll share the techniques, tips, and methods that will expand your
        current skill set and put you on a path to success.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Practice your new skills:</strong> <br />
        During the two weeks, you’ll develop a plan for how you’ll put your
        new skills into practice. You’ll see what works best for you and start
        building new habits of persuasion and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Live Coaching Sessions:</strong> <br />
        Each week, join one of our live coaching sessions, where Leslie,
        Jared, and the Center Centre team work with you and your fellow
        program attendees. Receive mentoring on your questions, big
        challenges, and plans for how you’ll win support and influence change.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ll host the sessions in a private program space inside our
        <strong>Leaders of Awesomeness</strong> community. There you’ll find
        the recordings for all the lessons and coaching sessions, along with
        session notes and workbooks for the practice sessions. You’ll have
        access to that space as long as you’re in the program (with an option
        to extend access once the program ends).

      <p>
        We’re quite serious when we say this. What you learn in this program
        will be skills, tools, and mindsets that you’ll use every day for the
        lifetime of your UX career. We’ve seen UX professionals take these
        techniques and successfully make a case for…

          Everything you learn in this 16-week program comes directly from the
          experience that Leslie and Jared have. They’ve been working for
          decades across industries, discovering the best practices of
          successful UX leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leslie and Jared joined forces in 2012. Since then, they have worked
          with top UX leaders at organizations like IBM, NASA, GE, Fidelity
          Investments, GM, Exxon Mobil, Dolby, and Adobe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leslie’s deep knowledge about leadership and human relationships is
          mind-bogglingly astute. You’ll find yourself asking, “how does she
          know that my stakeholders are exactly like that?”
