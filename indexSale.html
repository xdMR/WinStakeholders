          The 8 Pillars of Stakeholder Influence

      </div>
      <div class="pt-2">
        <p>
          Every UX leader reaches a point where their work needs to shift.
          Creating great designs and conducting meaningful UX research isn’t
          enough. They must overcome the pressures of the organization and,
          most importantly, they need the help of key stakeholders to make
          that happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          UX is a team sport. You need support and buy-in from your partners
          in product management and development. However, that support won’t
          come by itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve spent the last two decades studying how successful UX leaders
          get their peers to make UX a top priority. We’ve collected the
          techniques and perspectives that give these UX leaders an advantage
          in their organization.
        </p>

        Time Commitment and Program Schedule
      </h2>
      <h3>Commit 2-3 hours per week to see real change.</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>We hold a new program start date every month.</strong> Once you start the program, you’ll gain access to
        our private online learning space hosted in our Leaders of Awesomness community.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Then every two weeks, for the 16-weeks of the program,</strong> Leslie and Jared will introduce you to a
        brand new pillar of stakeholder influence. They’ll share the techniques, tips, and methods that will expand your
        current skill set and put you on a path to success.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You’ll join weekly live lab sessions every Wednesday for direct mentorship and guidance.</strong> For
        the first four weeks of the program, you can join a live lab session on Wednesdays at 11am ET (15.00 GMT) or at
        7pm ET (23.00 GMT). For the remaining twelve weeks, you can join the live lab sessions on Wednesday 1pm ET
        (17.00 GMT) or
        7pm ET (23.00 GMT).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Each live lab session is recorded, so you can catch up by watching the recording if you miss
          it.</strong> We usually have the recordings posted within 24 hours. If you have questions, you can put them in
        the discussion area in our community space.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Each week, there’s also a video about the topic to watch at your convenience and some homework to
          prepare for the labs.</strong> The videos are usually about 45 minutes long, and the homework can take 20 - 40
        minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Overall you’ll expect to spend about 2 to 3 hours a week on this program.</strong> That’s a 1 hour live
        lab session every week, a 1 hour video every other week, and ½ hour of intentional practice/homework every week.

      <p>
        We’re quite serious when we say this. What you learn in this program
        will be skills, tools, and mindsets that you’ll use every day for the

        techniques and successfully make a case for…

          starting an important research project that’s been back-burnered for
          the last 18 months.
        </li>
        <li>
          growing their UX team to better keep pace with product and
          development.
        </li>
        <li>
          expanding their organization’s research capability to influence
          strategic decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          shifting their organization to stop <em>saying</em> they’re

          Everything you learn in this 16-week program comes directly from Leslie and Jared's experience. They’ve been
          working for decades across industries, discovering the best practices of successful UX leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leslie and Jared joined forces in 2012. Since then, they have worked with top UX leaders at organizations like
          IBM, NASA, GE, Fidelity Investments, GM, Exxon Mobil, Dolby, and Adobe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leslie’s deep knowledge of leadership and human relationships is mind-bogglingly astute. You’ll ask yourself,
          “how does she know my stakeholders are exactly like that?”
